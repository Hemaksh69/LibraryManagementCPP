# ðŸ“š Simple Library Management System (C++)

This is a basic console-based C++ program that simulates a simple library system. It demonstrates the use of **C++ classes** and **Standard Template Library (STL)** containers like `queue`, `stack`, and `list` for managing books and users.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Add and manage a single book and user
- Borrow the book (if available) or join a waitlist
- Return the book and update its availability
- View user's borrow/return history using a stack

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- C++ classes (for Book and User)
- STL containers:
  - `queue` for the book waitlist
  - `stack` for user history
  - `list` for borrowed books
- Basic user input/output handling
- Simple memory management with `new` and `delete`
